# conventions
Conventions for Javascript and CSS for internal use at work.

## Why?

We at Kreativgebiet are mostly unsure whether to use a specific coding-style or not. This repository and it's modules should help getting back to this and specify conventions that are used by *everyone* at Kreativgebiet.

This repository and it's modules are using `eslint` and `stylelint` as linters. The modules should be the base in their boilerplates (`kickup` and `kickup-react`).

## How to use?

To use the modules, you just need to install them via NPM and reference in the `extends` blocks in your configuration. For further configuration and installation `README`s, please refer to the modules `README`.
